# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

* Number input now work properly again when you type into them (#391) Thanks @muwak
* Esoterrorists abilities: "Scuffling" now spelled correctly, and Health and Stability now have a minimum value of -12 (#397) Cheers @AlbertG73

## 7.4.0 (2023-08-05)

* Updated German translations (#380) Cheers @muwak!

## 7.3.2 (2023-07-11)

* BUG FIX: Initiative values were sometimes not being remembered if you refreshed the page. Fixed. (#346)

## 7.3.1 (2023-07-01)

* BUG FIX: The NBA Languages ability now actually uses the custom logic added in 7.3.0. (#333)
* BUG FIX: When a GM refreshes an NPC, it no longer broadcasts a message (#330)

## 7.3.0 (2023-06-30)

An unexpected release, to be sure, but a welcome one.

* Special handling for Night's black agents Languages, where the number of specialities is not just the same as the number of ranks. (#240)
* Support for languages (specifically, Polish) in which the "name" for an object is not the same as the "name" for a person. Thanks @marksjus (#284)
* Esoterrorists is now supported in Babele translations, including Polish Thanks @marksjus (#278)
* BUG FIX: Newly-created world now have "Drive" as the single personal detail, as intended. (#273)
* BUG FIX: Some fixes for Esoterrorists abilities (#276)
* BUG FIX: Some themes looked like ASS in Chrome because yours truly only uses Firefox, and although I do perform browser testing I evidently hadn't used the affected themes in Chrome until now. Thanks @marksjus again for the report (#279)
* BTS: The automatic dependency updater had stopped working. It's now back online, so this release includes a bunch of package updates which shouldn't change anything outwardly.


## 7.2.1 (2023-06-22)

* Add Polish strings for "Moribund World" to the system manifest. WHOOPS.

## 7.2.0 (2023-06-22)

### Headlines

* **The Esoterrorists** Thanks to @tbsvttr for the ability compendium pack, we now have bnuilt-in support for The Esoterrorists, (#261) including...
* **New character sheet theme: Unsafe Reality**
* Fully updated Polish translations, thanks to @marksjus

### And also:

* The config presets are now all named correctly for the system, rather than the quirky trademark-dodging names they had before. (#270)

### Behind the scenes stuff that only front-end devs will care about:

* I've replaced Jest and tsd with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the test runner. This was motivated by Jest's config getting increasingly painful to maintain for the way INVESTIGATOR is set up. Vitest just grabs your Vite config and goes from there, so it's dead easy.


## 7.1.0 (2023-06-16)

* GUMSHOE now works with Foundry v11! (it kinda did before but with some bugs, which have now been fixed.) (#244)
* Polish translations have been added fixed and completed, thanks @marksjus  (#246)
* The combat tracker is now resizable when popped out (#143)
* When you refresh a PC's abilities, a message is broadcast to the chat log (#230)

And finally:

* As a result of sorting out some issues found while integrating the Polish translations, I realised that a whole bunch of translations that had been contributed to Transifex had not made their way into any release. APOLOGIES to the folks who had contributed those strings. They are now included in this release. (#251)


## 7.0.0 (2023-06-01)

### The Headlines

* üéâü•≥üëå **INVESTIGATOR has been reborn as the official GUMSHOE system for Foundry VTT.** Huge thanks to Ellen and Cat at Pelgrane for making this happen.
  * You will still see the string "investigator" here and there for technical reasons, but the system is now called "GUMSHOE".
* **Full ability compendiums!** The built-in packs now contain full lists of abilities for their respective games and settings. No more having to type them in yourself! (#242)

### Other stuff which is cool but not as cool as the above

* **Weapons now have a "cost" field.** This was needed for some game settings (#130).
* **Situational modifiers!** These are specific +/- modifiers that apply to abilities in certain situations, like "+1 while flying" or "-3 near water". You can check them on or off before making your ability test (#129).
* **BUG FIX: Abilities with di√§ƒçri≈£ica≈Çs in their names will now sort correctly.** Thanks to Vivien DE BONA for the fix, and marksjus for a bug report (#204 and #239).
* To celebrate the recent release of Foundry v11, **GUMSHOE is now fully compatible with Foundry v10.** Yes, you read that right. I will get busy with v11 testing next üòÉ (#199)
* SMALL BUG FIX: The actor icon that appears in the chat bar is now correct for tokens actors that are not linked to a world actor (#203).
* Updates `es` and `pr-BR` translations from Musrha and Luiz Borges (#222 and #223)
* The occupation "subtitle" at the top of the character is now in sync with the occupation item. This matches how it used to be before we added occupation items. (#229)
* The font used for the NBA-related themes (Unica One) was hard to read, and has been replaced with Big Shoulders Text and Big Shoulders Display. Thanks @WillPlant#1676 (#243).
* Major version bump from 6 to 7 to celebrate the name change and the Foundry v10 full compatibility.

### BTS stuff of which I am very proud but should make little difference to users

* I've updated to **React 18**, which either means nothing to you, or is terribly exciting. If you're in the first group, please try to be excited on behalf of those of us in the second group (#154).
* The project has **switched back from GitLab to GitHub** (which is where it was back when it was called "Trail of Cthulhu for Foundry VTT" in 2020) This follows a general community shift away from GitLab, and also makes it easier for Pelgrane to be involved in the project (#156).
* Some really neat stuff with diff snapshot tests for the settings reducer. Again, please just nod and smile if this means nothing to you (#236).


## 6.2.0 (2023-03-08)

* A small release to introduce the optional ability to turn personal details back into text fields, like how they used to be.

## 6.2.0-beta.1 (2023-03-08)

* A small release to introduce the optional ability to turn personal details back into text fields, like how they used to be.

## 6.1.0 (2023-02-05)

Another "building block" release, with a big new feature that will make more sense further down the line.

* Big new feature: Personal Details. These replace the old "short notes" fields, which were just text boxes. "Personal Details" are a fully fledged item type, with images and text, which can be created, shared, put into compendium packs etc. Additionally, they can be linked to a compendium pack so that when you add the personal detail item to an actor, it can automatically add all the items in the compendium pack too! (#127)
* Small new feature: a visual indicator on the PC sheet when abilities are boosted (#146) Thanks P. Troilus for the idea.
* Small new feature: Boosted investigative abilities automatically restore 1 point after a spend. (#147) Thanks P. Troilus for the idea again.
* Bug fix: Regular players no longer see a spurious error message when the GM adds a non-player-controlled token to combat (#149) Thanks Inloy for the bug report.
* Bug fix: spend on attacks by NPCs without linked actor data now stick (#150) Thanks Rob Bush for the bug report.
* Bug fix: Using the built-in "save" button on the rich text editor actually saves the text now (#152) Thanks little old me for the bug report.

## 6.0.0 (2023-01-08)

* Equipment categories! The GM can now define "types" of equipment and named custom fields to be present for each type. For example, you might define "treasure" as a category, with a "value" field, and "tomes" with a "sanity cost". Tickets #128 and #64, in a pleasant binary rhyme. See the wiki at https://gitlab.com/n3dst4/investigator-fvtt/-/wikis/How-equipment-categories-work for full details, or come and say Hi in the Pelgrane discord server: https://discord.com/channels/692113540210753568/720741108937916518
* Bug fix: Images inserted in the rich text editor now show up correctly when the text is saved. Ticket #144.


## 6.0.0-beta-2 (2022-12-30)

* Bug fixes on equipment categories

## 6.0.0-beta-2 (2022-12-30)

* Updates minimum core Foundry version to 10.291

## 6.0.0-beta-1 (2022-12-30)

* Equipment categories! The GM can now define "types" of equipment and named custom fields to be present for each type. For example, you might define "treasure" as a category, with a "value" field, and "tomes" with a "sanity cost". Tickets #128 and #64, in a pleasant binary rhyme.
* Bug fix: Images inserted in the rich text editor now show up correctly when the text is saved. Ticket #144.

## 5.1.3 (2022-11-08)

* Fix #142 - the combat tracker should now be okay in v9 and v10. That thing is the absolute bane of my life.

## 5.1.2 (2022-09-02)

* Re-fix the combat sidebar in v10.

## 5.1.1 (2022-08-27)

* Fix a bug that stripped out custom fonts, if you're using the "Custom Fonts" module.
* Move the build and dev process to Vite. Gigantic thanks to the Lancer system devs for their write-up on this.

## 5.1.0 (2022-08-16)

* You can now remove the last item from all lists in settings except ability categories and combat abilities.
* You can now add and remove custom stats!
* The settings window has been given a small glow-up and now has tabs, which gives us more room to work with.

## 5.0.1 (2022-08-08)

* Typo in `minimumCoreVersion` ü§£

## 5.0.0 (2022-08-08)

* Drop support for FVTT 0.8.x.
* Various FVTT v10 compatibility fixes:
  * The combat tracker now looks right in FVTT v10.
  * Dropping actors onto the party sheets works in FVTT v10.
* Specialities with more than one word no longer get bunched up on the left.

## 4.12.0 (2022-06-12)

* A small release to include some new translations:
  * Polish (Core & SRD abilities)
  * Japanese (Core, SRD weapons, and Path of Cthulhu)

## 4.11.1 (2022-06-01)

* **Bug fix** New combat tracker show names, not IDs, now.
* **Bug fix** Ability specialities only show up once.
* **Bug fix** Double-clicking combatant now opens the actor sheet, like the standard combat tracker does.

## 4.11.1 (2022-06-01)

* **Bug fix** BIG WHOOPS. 4.11.0 incorrectly triggered an old migration which had the effect of wiping out actor notes and text fields. This version does not. Thanks to @Seamonster and Francesco Giorgi for reporting.

## 4.11.0 (2022-05-31)

* Presets, like themes, are now decoupled from the core system, so we can write modules which add support for new games.
* Numeric trackers can now be configured (instead of just having hard-coded hit threshold etc.) This is important for games which use other numeric counters which are not full abilities.
* The text shown when you don't have an occupation can now be configured. It used to be hard-coded as "Investigator" but can be anything, e.g. "Hero".
* The NPC sheet has a new layout.
* Unlockable talents - when you have more than a given number of ranks in an ability, show a badge indicating that a special talent has been unlocked.
* QoL tweaks to the "Edit" tab.
* New initiative tracker! No longer will you have to click an irrelevant d20 to "roll" initiative in Gumshoe.
* New *alternative* turn-passing combat tracker, for games which use "Popcorn"-style initiative.
* Various deprecation fixes.
* **Bug fix** Sheets now look right in Pop-Out (probably; this is the second time this has come up)

## 4.10.0 (2022-04-12)

* Basic testing against Foundry VTT v10. Seems okay to me so far?
* Character sheet themes are now decoupled from the main system, so you can:
  * Write Foundry modules that add themes to INVESTIGATOR, or
  * Throw some JSON in a folder in your local Foundry data to create a local theme!
* **Bug fix** The SRD ability "archaeology" was spelled "archeology" in the "Path of Cthulhu" compendium.

## 4.9.7 (2022-04-04)

* There was a bug in the way initiative order was being set that made it sometimes look as if it didn't work at all. Fixed now.
* Setting the actor icon sets the default token icon.
* Updated ES and CA translations (thank you!)
* New JA translations (thank you!!)

## 4.9.1 (2022-03-04)

* Minor fixes

## 4.9.0 (2022-03-03)

  * Better layout on the abilities page and items page

Happy new year! A big update.

* **Rich text support!** All the places where previously we had plain-text notes areas, you can ow choose to edit as either rich text (using Foundry's standard rich text editor,) [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) (if you're into that sort of thing), or plain text.
* Rules support for the **"Moribund World" system**, which is very similar to GUMSHOE but not quite.
* **The "Nuke" button is now hidden** unless you're using the [üßô Developer Mode](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/_dev-mode) module.
* Speaking of which, [üßô Developer Mode](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/_dev-mode) is now the preferred way to activate developer features.
* You can now set the **Initiative Ability** directly from the character sheet. This a great QoL feature, thanks to @yariv).
* German translations! Thanks to `@muwak` on Gitlab.
* **Bug fix** There were some missing translations around combat ordering. Fixed now.

* Behind-the-scenes code improvements (#53, #58).


## v4.6.0 (2021-10-20)

The main character sheet tab is now interactive and you can performs tests and spends directly from it instead of having to open the ability pop-up. There's also an "Edit" tab for rapid ability editing.
* **Behind the scenes** Two changes which won't be visible to the user, but which will affect development: 1. I've semi-automated pulling in translations from Transifex, so it'll be nice and easy to keep up to date with the translation contributions. 2. The way themes are authored has been completely refactored. This will bear fruit later.

## v4.5.0 (2021-10-04)

* **Casting the Runes** (#45) With thanks to The Design Mechanism, we have full support for [Casting the Runes](http://thedesignmechanism.com/Casting-the-Runes.php), the GUMSHOE-system RPG based on the works of M. R. James.

* **French translations!** Merci @algol.
* A compendium pack of default **SRD weapons** - thanks @yariv/@yarrriv

* **Notes field on abilities** (#19) This has been asked for by a few people.
* Abilities can be marked as **"Goes first in combat"**, and they will always go before anyone using an ability which is not marked as "goes first in combat". This lets you have a Night's Black Agents-style "guns go first" rule.
